    """SardanaNeXus

    Source implementation for Sardana NeXus files.

    Args:
        file_name (str): file name including extension,
          can include regex pattern.
        file_path (str, optional): file path - defaults to ``./``.

    Keyword Args:
        start_scan_number (uint): start of scan numbers to parse.

        read_and_forget (bool): clear data after read to save memory.
        update_before_read (bool): always update from source
          before reading scan data.

          re-generated of nexus file.

    Attributes:
        log (logging.logger): logger instance from logging.
        name (str): name of the source
